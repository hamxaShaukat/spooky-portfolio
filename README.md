# 👻 Hamza Shaukat – Haunted Developer Portfolio 👨‍💻

Welcome to the source code for my **spooky-themed developer portfolio** — an unconventional, creative take on showcasing my skills, projects, and web development journey. Built with modern tools and powered by curiosity (and a few ghosts 👀), this site highlights what I love about building for the web.

> 💡 Want a more traditional version? I'm also working on a clean, professional variant for broader audiences.
